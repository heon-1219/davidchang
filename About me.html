					<h2>About me</h2>
				</header>
				<p>Hello! I am an international(F-1) undergraduate student at University of Texas at Austin. I plan to graduate with a double major in Computer Science and Electrical Computer Engineering, with research interest in clinical data. Currently, I am actively participating in student research opportunities with research subjects related to my interests, which are: Computer Science in AI/ML, Medical Data Analysis, and Embedded Systems for ECE. I'm involved with two labs: AI Health Lab at UT Austin, and BioInformatics Lab at Ajou University Medical Center. At the BioInformatics Lab, I am working 10AM to 5PM, hoping to achieve a deeper understanding in my aforementioned fields of academic interest.</p>

				<p>After my undergraduate and masters in Computer Science, I plan to apply for an MD-PhD program. To achieve this goal, I am actively involved in research / volunteer experiences, while dedicating effort to maintain a GPA for the MD-PhD program's competitiveness in GPA. I have an entrepreneurial side as well, initiating projects that use AI/ML technology and web programming knowledge to create websites with innovative algorithms enforced, that aim to solve real-world problems.</p>

				<p>In terms of work ethics and environment, I highly enjoy working with like-minded people who are willing to change the world. I work the best in team-based environments, as I enjoy communicating and exploring new ideas. I also enjoy providing knowledge to others, for example, tutoring. Teaching others offers me the opportunities to re-explore the topics I thought I knew, in a different perspective as it requires substantial knowledge to explain. Plus, I enjoy building relationships based on learning, so that's a bonus to myself.</p>
			
			    <p>Outside of my academic career, I enjoy playing the piano during my freetime. Classics are my favorite, since my favorite composers are Sergei Rachmaninoff and Franz Liszt. My current favorite pieces are Un Sospiro and Liebestraum No. 3 by Liszt. My goal is to be able to play like Dmitri Shishkin(for 2~3 pieces), however, it seems that there is a long way to go(10+ years expected). I've been playing piano since I was four, and I enjoy listening to classical music as much as playing the piano. I also enjoy spending time with my family, but I do not get to spend much time with them since I study in the United States.</p>
			
			    <p>I am open to any opportunities for learning, so please feel free to reach out or inquire!
